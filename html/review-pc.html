                  So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general.
                  Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to
                  this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years
                  since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me
                  its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I
                  bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around
                  sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone
                  through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all
                  amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more
                  games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time.
                  I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and
                  have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor
                  glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother
                  me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this
                  is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game.

                  I have played this game from almost day one and after seven
                  plus years of playing have racked up an insane amount of
                  hours. I found lifelong friends on this game and despite some
                  downward spirals it has taken, I believe Ark is one of the
                  best games I have ever played. I have played it to the point
                  of near burnout and still always come back for more. There is
                  no other game like it and the lore and story though hard to
                  follow until you know how have enthralled me. Cannot wait for
                  Ark 2 and hope it lives up to this first installment!

                  Playing solo, I load up the school map for the first time. I
                  stop and appreciate how big and unnerving the map is. I check
                  my equipment. I look around some more. I realize that I'm
                  putting off going any further. The phone down the hall rings.
                  After changing my pants, I start to hunt down where the
                  ringing came from. All the way down the hall, huh? But the
                  front door is all the way over here, and... oh, fine. I track
                  down the room, pull out the EMF meter, which immediately jumps
                  to 5. I throw down my book, ask the ghost to write in it
                  (well, what came out was "Okaydothethinghurryup"), then sort
                  of moonwalk my way back down the hall while chanting
                  variations of "Nope". One Alt+F4 later, and I'm here writing
                  this review. Nothing even happened, I simply psyched myself
                  out. Now that's a horror game.

                  Made a cozy base under a cliff with the boys, made a dope
                  tree-house and hunted some deer. Base gets raided at night by
                  cannibals and 2 six-legged titty monsters whose faces look
                  like uncircumcised peckers. We escape by boat and become
                  nomads, live out our lives on the run cannibalizing the
                  cannibals. Ignored saving our son in favor of building a dope
                  gazebo and huge cannibal-proof spiked-wall. 10/10 camping trip
                  with the boys. This is the most fun I've had in a long time
                  while not spending an huge amount of money for a game.

                  I pay 70$ and almost 100 hours into the game everything is
                  fine and dandy no issues, just having fun, but when I start
                  getting a little "good", I get banned for absolutely no reason
                  at all. "Unauthorized software" and "Data Manipulation" I've
                  never cheated on a steam game and I don't even know how. I
                  even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got
                  denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human
                  being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there
                  power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their
                  company to reach a real person in the support area, instead
                  everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their
                  website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting
                  it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response,
                  can't even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also
                  it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple
                  people, they don't get help at all and they are basically
                  getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings,
                  (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned
                  because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I
                  can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my
                  library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are
                  usually content creators or people who draw in attention or
                  money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly
                  doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over
                  thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.
                  I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and
                  they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.
